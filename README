BaconCore NG 0.2
A bot framework thing based off of bashbot.

Preface
In my free time, I created a bot framework called BaconCore, with the intention that it would be written entirely using Bash. It worked, surprisingly. However, adding functionality to it was, quite simply put, a pain. BaconCore NG is based off of bashbot, which makes adding functionality much simpler than it was before on the older, more crude BaconCore 0.1. It keeps with the goal of keeping it based on Bash, while being able to extend the functionality to my needs and made a much better base for modification.

Requirements
The botcore Azunyan should be able to run on almost any GNU/Linux based system. However, it was tested to work on the following:
- Debian GNU/Linux 8.4 "Jessie"
- GNU bash 4.3.30
- GNU coreutils 8.23

Modifications done for open source release
The BaconCore botcore "Azunyan" was modified slightly to remove some commands as well as some code cleanup.

How to use
Simply modify the configuration for the 'core' that you want, then enable it with enabledcore and run baconcore-launcher.

License
BaconCore NG and Azunyan are licensed under the GNU GPL license, please see COPYING for more details.

If you use Azunyan/BaconCore, I'd like to hear about it (though it's not a requirement)!
